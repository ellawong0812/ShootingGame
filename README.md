The game featured three challenging levels, with the highest difficulty level presenting moving spaceships that posed a significant challenge for players to successfully attack.

Implemented a feature to store the game records in a text file after each session, allowing players to track their progress and review their cumulative records. 
Additionally, incorporated a sorting mechanism to display the game results in a sorted order, providing players with clear visibility of their performance over time.
